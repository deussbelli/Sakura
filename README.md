# Sakura: Encryption Machine 1.0
Machine for encrypting and decrypting files in different ways

[![GitHub repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Sakura-blue)](https://github.com/deussbelli/Sakura.git)

## Overview
**Sakura** is an encryption machine designed to encrypt and decrypt text using various encryption algorithms. This tool is ideal for those interested in cryptography and learning how different ciphers work.

## Features
Sakura provides functionality for the following encryption and decryption methods:
- **Scytale Cipher**: A transposition cipher that rearranges the characters of the plaintext.
- **Caesar Cipher**: A substitution cipher that shifts the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of places.
- **Cardano Grille Cipher**: A cipher that involves using a mask to reveal hidden text within a grid.
- **Vigenère Cipher**: A polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword to shift the alphabet.
- **Affine Cipher**: A cipher that combines multiplication and addition to encrypt text.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deussbelli/Sakura.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```Run the program using your preferred IDE or compile and run it directly.  ```

## Usage
1. Choose the type of cipher you wish to use from the provided options.
2. Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt.
3. Provide any necessary parameters (e.g., shift key for Caesar, keyword for Vigenère).
4. View the output text after processing.
   
## Example
**Caesar Cipher**
- Input: "HELLO WORLD", Shift Key: 3
- Output (encrypted): "KHOOR ZRUOG" 

**Vigenère Cipher**
- Input: "HELLO WORLD", Keyword: "KEY"
- Output (encrypted): "RIJVS UYVJN"
